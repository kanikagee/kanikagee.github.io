<section id="series-synopsis">
<h2>Series Synopsis</h2>
<p><em>The R-Mystery Series</em> by Enid Blyton AKA <em>The Barney Mysteries</em> are a series of adventure cum mystery stories whose names all begin with the letter <em>R</em>. The stories all feature a group of young kids, who in typical Enid Blyton style stumble upon strange goings on and untangle exciting mysteries, thus helping out the police force.</p>
<p>The four main characters in the series are Roger and Diana who are siblings around the age of twelve, their younger orphan cousin Peter, usually known as Snubby, and Barnabus, a circus boy who is almost always called Barney.</p>
<p>Snubby is a bright, mischievous and cheeky orphan who lives with a variety of relatives, but Mrs. Lynton, mother of Roger and Diana, is his favorite aunt and he particularly likes spending his holidays with Roger and Diana. Snubby's faithful companion Looney is a lovable black spaniel who creates havoc wherever he goes.</p>
<p>Barney is a circus boy Roger, Diana and Snubby encounter in the first book during a holiday, when they are all staying with Miss Pepper, Mrs. Lynton's old governess. Miss Pepper too regularly features in the mysteries.</p>
<p>Barney too is an orphan. His mother died some time ago, and his father is unaware of his existence. So Barney has to fend for himself by working intermittently for fairs, circuses and shows. Barney is intelligent, resourceful and well mannered and endears himself not only to the children but also Mr. &amp; Mrs. Lynton and Miss Pepper. Barney has no extended family he knows of and considers Roger, Diana and Snubby to be his closest friends. He is thrilled to be welcomed so warmly by their family and friends. But he does hope to find his father someday. All he knows about his father is that at some point he acted in Shakespearean plays. Does Barney really do something about finding his father or is it just something he fantasizes about? Will he ever meet his father? Read on to find out.</p>
<p>A most unusual and entertaining character in the stories is Barney's most faithful friend, a monkey Miranda, who also makes herself useful at the circuses and fairs where Barney works.</p>

<section id="what-i-liked-about-the-series">
<h2>What I Liked About The Series</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>While each book tackles a different adventure/mystery story there is an over all story arc across the books about Barney and his quest for his dad.</p></li>
<li><p>As the series progresses, the children grow fonder of Miss Pepper, who is present in most of the stories. We also learn many little fascinating and unexpected things about her, which seem most unusual for a prim and proper old lady.</p></li>
<li><p>Barney's character is an odd combination of self-confidence and insecurities. While Barney is resourceful, intelligent, agile, strong and very good at looking after himself, he is self-conscious of his lack of education, nice clothes, and particularly personal hygiene that is difficult to maintain without a proper place to live. In spite of having strong principles and a good heart Barney worries that he lacks proper manners. I enjoyed seeing how he responded to changing circumstances through out the series and felt very sorry for him in the <em>Rubadub Mystery</em>, where some was cruel enough to take advantage of his greatest vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p>Barney, who has no access to education, is enthralled by the lessons the rest of the kids have to have and is eager to listen in, while the rest of the children who have the lessons thrust upon them, are always complaining and trying to avoid them.</p></li>
<li><p>I was thrilled to discover one more Enid Blyton series. I wasn't aware of this one as a child, and was recently introduced to it by a friend. It made me nostalgic for my childhood days of devouring one Enid Blyton book after another.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="some-context">
<h2>Some Context</h2>
<p>In recent years Enid Blyton's books have been criticized a lot for racism. As a feminist this book made me cringe a little. It's always Diana, the only girl in the group of children, who is shown doing chores like making beds and helping with the washing while the boys usually only help with outdoorsy stuff or machinery. She is also left out of the more risky adventures often by her own choice, and at other times because her brother and Barney insist on it, for her safety. May be it was because I first read the Five Find-Outers mystery series when I was much younger, but I don't remember it being as gender biased as this one.</p>
<p>While this bothers me, I am also aware that fixed gender roles were a common reality in the time these books were penned. So the books are representative of the existing society. Some people believe we should not let our kids read such books because it reinforces the sexism that persists in modern society. I don't believe we should hide from our past, but that we should try to learn from it. I believe that we should let our kids read these stories that are quite remarkable in many ways. But along with the merits, we should also point out the short comings and discuss the problematic issues or racism and sexism openly with them and show them how times have changed and how much more needs to change and can change in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>A smashing mystery isn't complete without smashing teas!</strong></p>
